A totally useful Flutter package for generating random Balablu sounds.

## Overview

The **balablu** package provides a simple way to generate random Balablu sounds in your Flutter application (very crucial stuff for your app you know. Absolutely not uselessðŸ™ƒ.). It also lets you control the frequency at which the audio clip is played and provides an option to disable the sound by shaking the device (nifty, that.ðŸ˜Œ).


## Usage

On Android, inlcude the VIBRATE permission in AndroidManifest.xml:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
```


Import the **balablu** package:

```dart
import 'package:balablu/balablu.dart';
```

Initialize Balablu sound generation:

```dart
await Balablu.init();
```

This will initialize the Balablu sound generator with the default settings. The audio clip will be played at a very low frequency.

You can customize the frequency using the `Frequency` class. The smaller the frequency value, the fewer times the audio clip is played. The `Frequencies` class provides some predefined frequency constants:

* `Frequencies.veryLow`
* `Frequencies.low`
* `Frequencies.medium`
* `Frequencies.high`
* `Frequencies.veryHigh`

You can also pass a `Frequency` object to the `init()` method to set a custom frequency:

```dart
// That's really low by the way.
await Balablu.init(frequency: Frequency(milliHertz: 2));
```

By default, shaking the device will toggle the sound on or off. When the device is shook, it vibrates for one second to indicate disabling, and half a second to indicate enabling. 

If you want to disable this feature, you can set the `shakeToDisable` parameter to `false`:

```dart
await Balablu.init(shakeToDisable: false);
```
